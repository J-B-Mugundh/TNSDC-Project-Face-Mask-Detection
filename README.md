# TNSDC-Project-Face-Mask-Detection
This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras to classify individuals as "with mask" or "without mask" in real-time. Using a dataset of preprocessed images, the model is trained and deployed for efficient mask detection, ensuring adherence to safety protocols.
